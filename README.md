Corey and Alex are very particular developers. The office goes on a walk every day at 3pm to get some much needed excersise and fresh air after a long day of coding. This app is to help Corey or Alex determine whether the weather meets their criteria for walking.

Link to deployed app: https://bash7325.github.io/walk-o-clock/

Future development: Make non mobile views more interesting. Android app is ready to go, just waiting on Google to verify me so I can publish.
